Obtain a certificate using Certbot The Certbot app recommends using the &amp;lsquo;snap&amp;rsquo; package manager for installation. First we&amp;rsquo;ll make sure Snapd is installed and updated to handle the Certbot app installation. We then install the app, confirm that the command is correctly &amp;lsquo;linked&amp;rsquo; and then we&amp;rsquo;ll request a certificate.
Update snapd sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core Install Certbot app sudo snap install --classic certbot Prepare the Certbot command sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot If Apache is currently running, disable it so Certbot can use the port sudo systemctl stop apache2.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started</title><link>https://wiki.casat.org/casat_resources/getting_started/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.casat.org/casat_resources/getting_started/</guid><description>After being issued your computer equipment at CASAT you should check the following:

robocopy &amp;lt;Source&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Destination&amp;gt; [&amp;lt;File&amp;gt;[...]] [&amp;lt;Options&amp;gt;] In practice it will look something like this
robocopy $NETWORK_PATH $NEW_NETWORK_PATH /e /zb /dcopy:t /copy:all /r:2 /w:5 /v /tee /LOG:$PATH_TO_LOG List Only Flag
It&amp;rsquo;s strongly suggested to do a test run with a robocopy command first to make sure you get the intended results, especially when the command involves moving files across the network.</description></item><item><title>Adding logins with Apache</title><link>https://wiki.casat.org/it_resources/server_notes/htpasswd/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.casat.org/it_resources/server_notes/htpasswd/</guid><description>Following these directions will add a username and password prompt to a website or specific webpage.

Do not use names like &amp;lsquo;Tamale&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;WordPress&amp;rsquo;. The hostname set here will be referenced by Ansible later and setting to something other than the Domain name can cause issues later on.</description></item><item><title>Ansible: Migrating WordPress</title><link>https://wiki.casat.org/it_resources/wordpress/ansible_migrate/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.casat.org/it_resources/wordpress/ansible_migrate/</guid><description>08/25/2022
Here are the steps for copying one WordPress website to another using Ansible. Prior to working through these steps you should have already created a &amp;lsquo;blank&amp;rsquo; WordPress website using either the Ansible method or the Bash method and have a snapshot of the droplet already saved.

Panopticon is the monitoring server that we use to monitor the logs and metrics of our many servers. The site works on a stack of Linux, Apache, Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana. The server is accessible at panopticon.casat.org.
In order to collect the metrics, Prometheus utilizes a few &amp;lsquo;exporters&amp;rsquo; which are small apps used to either collect information or forward information on to the Prometheus server. On the panopticon server there is the Blackbox Exporter installed to periodically ping our remote servers and collect connectivity statistics.</description></item><item><title>Remote Workers</title><link>https://wiki.casat.org/casat_resources/remote/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.casat.org/casat_resources/remote/</guid><description>If you are one of our remote workers you will receive a laptop from us for work use at home.
