Users at CASAT will be issued two different email accounts, an @casat.org email address accessed though Gmail and assigned by CASAT, and an @unr.edu email address accessed through Outlook and assigned by UNR IT. It can be confusing to manage both of these email accounts a

## Logging in with an @casat.org email account

Users at CASAT are issued @casat.org email addresses that can be accessed anywhere via the [Gmail](www.gmail.com) website. For their first login, Users should receive an invitation in their personal email that includes their temporary password. If a User is unable to find that information please reach out to CASAT IT.

## Reporting spam or phishing messages

Properly reporting malicious spam or phishing messages in Gmail can help protect others.

[Spam](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/spam) messages are unsolicited messages that a user receives, typically in the form of an Ad.

[Phishing](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/how-recognize-avoid-phishing-scams) messages are requests for information in the form of an Email or other message. Typically these messages contain a link that a user clicks on and then is prompted to input their credentials.

Gmail uses an AI to check messages for malicious intent and can both prevent and remove malicious messages from Users' accounts. If several users report a message as spam or phishing then Gmail will take action and remove the offending message from all users inboxes, as well as send IT a report about the message.
