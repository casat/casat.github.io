At CASAT we have access to two types of accounts; user accounts through our UNR NetID's, and we have some specialized group accounts managed by ourselves. All CASAT employees have access to a 'pro' tier Zoom account through their UNR NetId's. These NetId accounts are what most users should primarily be using for hosting meetings, and the pro tier accounts give us access to most of the Zoom features.
