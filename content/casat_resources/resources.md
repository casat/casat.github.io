## Email Access

### GSuite/GMail
- At CASAT we use a non-profit GSuite/Gmail account for our primary email accounts. All CASAT employees are assigned an @casat.org email address that they can access over the web by going to [gmail.com](https://gmail.com) and signing in with your @casat.org account.
### Outlook
- UNR provides and official email address for all UNR employees as well. It's important to regularly check this email account as UNR Administration will only send official correspondence to @unr.edu email accounts. You can check this account over the web by going to [office.com](https://www.office.com) and signing in with your UNR NetId@unr.edu, or directly on your computer with the 'Outlook' app.
