At CASAT we utilize two different texting services depending on your need, either TextMagic or EZTexing.

{{< hint warn >}}
**New Accounts**\
When making new accounts for either of these services, please keep in mind you should use a CASAT 'group' email account. As this allows for greater user control within CASAT and helps us keep up continuity of operations. If you have questions about this please contact either the IT or Media teams and they can assist you prior to making any new accounts with either service.

## TextMagic
TextMagic is the more commonly used service and is relatively straight forward, in that you will create a list of users for a class and then schedule the messages in the system you wish to send to that list.

### Getting started with TextMagic

1. Login/Create an account
    - You will login to TextMagic with a CASAT group email account. If you do not already have a login, please get in touch with the IT or Media teams to check that an appropriate CASAT group email account exists for use.

2. Create a new contact list and add your participants

    - [Import your contacts from a CSV or Excel file into your contact list](https://support.textmagic.com/article/import-contacts/)

3. Schedule your messages for your list
    - [Schedule your messages and assign the group in TextMagic](https://support.textmagic.com/article/schedule-text-messages/)

4. Check that your number is activated
    - Verify that your 'dedicated virtual number' is activated. Or [purchase a new number](https://support.textmagic.com/article/buy-a-textmagic-dedicated-number-subscription/) if it is not currently active.
    - As of March 2022, all phone numbers purchased through TextMagic will need to be registered with the 10DLC Campaign. You can find information about how to complete this process on the [TextMagic 10DLC info page.](https://support.textmagic.com/article/10dlc-messaging/)

5. Add credits to the account if needed
    - Check that you have enough credit in your account to cover the costs of the messages you just scheduled. If you do not already have enough you will need to add additional credit to your account.
    - When adding credits, make sure you choose the 'Pay-as-you-go' option.

## EZ Texting

EZTexting is a bit different, for EZTexting we create 'keywords' which a user texts to our phone number and is then automatically enrolled in a 'drip marketing' campaign, which is a pre-created schedule of messages. These campaigns require a bit more planning out since the messages are largely static once the program is setup. Additionally these accounts require monthly subscriptions and cannot be turned off/on at will. If you are interested in getting started with EZTexting or are thinking about utilizing a 'keyword' based opt-in system you should contact the IT or Media teams to help get you started.
