This website has answers for many of the most common requests we get from our users. You can use the navigation bar on the left to move between sections. The CASAT Resources section refers to any services that are managed internally by CASAT and typically utilize our @casat.org email accounts. The UNR Resources section refers to any services that are managed by UNR and typically utilize your UNR issued NetId, or email address.

### Google Team Drive

Through our @casat.org Gmail accounts we have access to the Google Drive and Team Drive storage features. The Google Drive storage should only be used for personal or temporary storage and that it is not adequate for permanent use. Otherwise it is preferred to use a Google Team Drive for saving files and collaborating within your team. You can find the Team Drives within Google Drive listed as 'Shared Drives', these drives must be created by IT initially and then sharing can be managed by the team. If you need a new Team Drive created within Google please reach out to IT.
