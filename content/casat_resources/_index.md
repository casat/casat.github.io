This website has answers for many of the most common requests we get from our users. You can use the navigation bar on the left to move between sections. The CASAT Resources section refers to any services that are managed internally by CASAT and typically utilize our @casat.org email accounts. The UNR Resources section refers to any services that are managed by UNR and typically utilize your UNR issued NetId, or email address.

## Email Access

### GSuite/GMail

GSuite is the name for the suite of services provided by Google through our Gmail accounts. Through our GSuite accounts we get access to services like Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive/Team Drive, and many others. If you are logged into your @casat.org Gmail account, you can look at the available services in the [GSuite Workspace Dashboard.](https://workspace.google.com/dashboard)
- You can access your @casat.org email account by going to gmail.com
    - If you are a new employee you should provided with your Email name and Password from your supervisor.
    - Contact IT if you have any needs for 'group' accounts within Gmail
- The Google Chat/Hangouts Chat is preferred way to chat/message other CASAT employees
    - The Google Hangouts Video Chat and Meet Video are available but are largely unused due to our Zoom preference

## Storage options

At this time we have several options for file storage. It is best if you check with your supervisor on what methods your team is using.

### Google Drive

Through our @casat.org Gmail accounts we have access to the Google Drive feature. Google Drive is a cloud storage option that allows you to upload, download, and manage files from anywhere over the internet. Through Google Drive folders and files can be shared with other users, including users external to CASAT. It should be noted that these folders and files 'belong' to the user that creates them and are not centrally managed by CASAT IT, so it is not appropriate for long-term storage for important files. There are also Shared Drives within Google Drive whose folders and files are centrally managed by CASAT IT, it is ok to use these Shared Drives for long-term storage.
- You can access your Google Drive from within your CASAT email inbox
    - Click on the 'dot grid' in the upper right hand corner of your Gmail inbox
        - Select 'Drive' from the list of apps
- There is a desktop app available for Google Drive you can get from the [Google Drive website](https://www.google.com/drive/download/)
