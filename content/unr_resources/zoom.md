## Using your NetId to login to Zoom on the web
- To use your UNR NetId Zoom login over the web you need to make sure you are using the specific UNR Zoom web portal.
    - https://unr.zoom.us
    - From there you can login with your UNR NetId

{{< hint info >}}
**Not seeing the UNR login screen?**\
In some cases browsers are not correctly interpreting the unr.zoom.us web address and are instead just taking users to the typical Zoom login screen. If you are on that screen you can still use your NetId there are just a few extra steps. From the 'Sign In' screen you need to select the 'SSO' option for sign in. At the 'Sign In with SSO' you will be asked to provide a Company Domain, here you should put in 'unr', the domain should read unr.zoom.us. Once you continue on you will be taken to a UNR branded login screen where you can login with your NetId.

### 3. Using SSO (single sign on) to login to Zoom with your UNR NetId

- When prompted to 'Enter your company domain', input: `unr`
    - The domain should read - `unr.zoom.us`

### 4. Confirming Zoom account
- Once you are signed into the Zoom app, you can check on which account you are using by clicking on the 'account' icon in the upper right corner of the app.
    - If you click on your account icon it should show you as 'licensed' and show your partial email with @unr.edu on the end
