## 1. Download the Zoom app
- Use [this link](https://zoom.us/support/download) to go to the Zoom website and download the Zoom app if you do not already have it
    - Chrome should automatically start the download, otherwise you may need to click on the link to start the download manually

## 2. Install the Zoom app
- Once the download has completed, click on the download at the bottom of the screen
- If you get a 'security warning' window, you are ok to tell it to 'Run'
- Once the installer has completed you will get a window with two options: 'Join a Meeting' or 'Sign in'
    - Select 'Sign In'

## 3. Using SSO (single sign on) to login to Zoom with your UNR NetId
- At the Sign In window select the 'SSO' option at the bottom of the screen
- When prompted to 'Enter your company domain', input: `unr`
    - The domain should read - `unr.zoom.us`
- Once you have filled that in, you will be taken to a UNR sign in page where you can sign in with your UNR NetId

## 4. Confirming Zoom account
- Once you are signed into the Zoom app, you can check on which account you are using by clicking on the 'account' icon in the upper right corner of the app.
    - If you click on your account icon it should show you as 'licensed' and show your partial email with @unr.edu on the end

## - Using Zoom with your UNR NetId on the web
- To use your UNR NetId Zoom login over the web you need to make sure you are using the UNR Zoom web portal.
