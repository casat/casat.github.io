Below is a list of resources available to CASAT staff through their UNR NetId's. This list does not cover everything available, only the most commonly used resources. This list is also geared towards CASAT staff for 'professional or administrative' purposes, if you are a staff member teaching UNR students you may need to utilize specific resources not listed here.

## Email Access

All UNR employees are assigned Email addresses through Microsoft Exchange. By default the email address will be the employee's NetId@unr.edu, and the password is the same NetId password. You can check this email on the web through the Microsoft Office portal at [office.com](https://www.office.com), and using your NetId@unr.edu and NetId password to login.
- If you are getting a new employee started and need to activate their email, [you can find the directions here.](https://unr.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2684/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=117055)
- If you would like to check your email using the Outlook client on your computer.
    - Open the Outlook app from the Windows menu, when prompted for account information fill in your NetId@unr.edu and password, from there the client should be able to figure out the rest of the information automatically.
    - When you first login to your email via the Outlook desktop app, be aware that it may take some time to sync all of your emails.
- If you have any issues or need instructions for connecting your email account to other Apps/Clients check in the [Employee Email](https://unr.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2684/Portal/KB/?CategoryID=19232) section of the UNR IT website.
