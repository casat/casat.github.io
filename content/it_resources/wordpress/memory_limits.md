There are two common ways we see memory limits increased in WordPress, through changes to the .htaccess file, or creation of a php.ini file. Updating the .htaccess method is the 'old' way of doing this, but it does usually work the easiest. Creating a new php.ini file and increasing the memory limits there is the preferred way to do this now, and will be more futureproof as start transitioning away from HTTP1.1 to HTTP2.
