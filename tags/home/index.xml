Our typical remote setup includes a laptop, monitor, keyboard and mouse (and dock if necessary), all of which will be sent to you. On a typical setup you would plug the monitor into the laptop which will allow you to use either the monitor or both the monitor and the laptop as screens, and then the mouse and keyboard into the laptop.</description></item></channel></rss>
